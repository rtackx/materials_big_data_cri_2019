    "The documentation of YouTube API is here : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to make calls on Youtube API, you must provide a *key*. This key is requiered to retrieve *resources* and serves as a way to authentificate someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To retrieve a resource you need to create a *HTTP request* and send it to a specific API __url__. This can be done by using python package *requests*, cf. *requests.get(url, parameters, header)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By doing so, your request is then evaluated by YouTube API and a response is sent back to you. Typically, when the request is valid (use *is_valid_response*), a JSON is provided containing the resource requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To access a resource, you will need to create a HTTP request that contains a list of parameters defined by the resource you want to access :\n",
    "    - the API __key__ \n",
    "    - one or several *required parameters*\n",
    "    - one or several *other parameters*\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: *https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search* (see doc. https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) allows to search for contents based on keywords. For this resource, it requires a parameter __part__ that specifies the type of properties you will retrieve."
